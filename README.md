# KeyboardOptimizer
Optimize the Dvorak keyboard layout to not have "L" in a silly place.

This project was inspired by me deciding to get an ortholinear keyboard. I type in a somewhat silly way for qwerty, and I'd like to type properly.
Thus, I set out to learn a new keyboard layout. Dvorak and Colemak both seemed nice, but while Colemak is probably superior, I actively want my layout to be as different as possible from qwerty to force me to relearn my habits.
I chose Dvorak, but the placement of the "L" as well as the punctuation keys had me somewhat peeved. So I decided to modify it.

This project is my attempt at creating a keyboard layout optimizer that can evaluate a given keyboard layout. From there, I can try out different ideas for my personal layout.

Inspired by carpalX.

My final result, after some reorganizing, was the following:

. , u q x b w d h v /

a o e i y g s t n r

. ; z p j f c k m l


Vowels and low frequency consonants on the left, high frequency consonants on the right, optimized to avoid same-finger repeated typing.
